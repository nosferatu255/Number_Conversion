# Number_Conversion

Old version:

Converting numbers from decimal to binary , decimal to hexadecimal....
When starting the program from python shell mind that the program will elapse when the conversion 
is done so copy the code to an IDE or put empty inputs at the ends of each conversion.

New Version:

no problems
